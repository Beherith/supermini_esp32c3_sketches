 * pin_names.ino
 *
 * List I/O pin names and numbers of supported Super Mini ESP32-C3 boards
 *     - Nologo ESP32C3 Super Mini
 *     - MakerGO C3 SuperMini
 *
 * In the Arduino IDE use board 'Nologo ESP32C3 Super Mini' or 
 * 'MakerGO C3 SuperMini'. These board definitions for the 
 * Super Mini boards are not contained in the currently 
 * (2024-05-08) available stable release of the Arduino-esp32 
 * core (@ https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32). They
 * should be included in the next stable release.
 *
 * Until then, use release candidate 1 of version 3.0.0 of the 
 * esp32 core. To do that, add the following boards manager 
 * configuration file
 *   https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_dev_index.json
 * in the Arduino IDE preferences.
 *
 * With the stable version 2.0.16 of the esp32 Arduino core, use board
 * 'ESP32C3 Dev Module' and ensure that the `USB CDC on BOOT' option 
 * is 'Enabled'.
 * 
 
 * 'BUILTIN_LED' and 'LED_BUILTIN' will not be correct with these
 * three board definitions.
 
 * This is a stub to satisfy the Arduino IDE, the source code is in
 * the file main.cpp in the same directory.
 *
 * This sketch will compile in the Arduino IDE and in PlatformIO
