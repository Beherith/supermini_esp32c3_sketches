 * Wi-Fi station connect example
 *
 * In the Arduino IDE use board 'Nologo ESP32C3 Super Mini' or
 * 'MakerGO C3 SuperMini'. These board definitions for the
 * Super Mini boards are not contained in the currently 
 * (2024-05-08) available stable release of the Arduino-esp32
 * core (@ https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32). They
 * should be included in the next stable release.
 *
 * Until then, use release candidate 1 of version 3.0.0 of the
 * esp32 core. To do that, add the following boards manager
 * configuration file
 *   https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_dev_index.json
 * in the Arduino IDE preferences.

 * This is a stub to satisfy the Arduino IDE, the source code is in
 * the file main.cpp in the same directory.
 *
 * This sketch will compile in the Arduino IDE and in PlatformIO
